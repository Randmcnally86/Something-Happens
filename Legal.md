Whatever is in the repository belongs to ADS.  
If you post something to this repository, it can be used by ADS, or not, at any time in the future.

An Example.  
Jeremy Owens built a truely horrible first draft for the purposes of testing github repositories, among other things.  
Jeremy Owens owns the copyright for this draft.  
Jeremy Owens adds the draft to the repository.  
ADS can now do anything they want with the draft; let it sit, edit it, post as is, convert to a different format, etc.  
Jeremy Owens later publishes the draft, and a revised version of the draft to another repository, as he still owns the copyright.  
Jeremy Owens also adds the text of J.K. Rowling's "Fantastic Beasts & Where to Find Them" to the ADS repository.  
ADS will delete the text as soon as they know the text wasn't made by Jeremy Owens.
ADS will also report the matter as widely as possible.
